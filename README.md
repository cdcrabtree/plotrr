## plotrr

Social scientists can do better research by doing more exploratory data analysis (Tukey 1977). One reason why they might not, however, is because it takes additional time. This is particularly true for R users, who do not have single-line commands for many common visual EDA techniques. plotrr helps address this issue by providing several functions that make visual EDA easier to conduct. In addition to these funtions, the package also contains several other _helper_, or convenience, functions.
